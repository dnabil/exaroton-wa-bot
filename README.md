# ⚡ Wake up babe, the server is on! ⚡

So your SMP is basically a **WhatsApp graveyard** now? ☠️

Server&#39;s got a better sleep schedule than you, cuz **nobody actually plays together**? 😴

AND you&#39;re still rocking that **pay-as-you-go Exaroton struggle**?

<h3> Bro, just start the server from the group chat. </h3>

Literally, just @ the bot and type:

`/start [server-name]`

✨ BOOM. Server wakes up. Your friends see it. Gaming resumes.
No more "Yo is the server up?" messages at 2 AM.

It can also stop server, check the server info, etc.
